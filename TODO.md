Tips and Practices
==================
* public interface should be super clear
* separate creation (factory, builder, provider, wiring objects) from use (business logic, domain abstraction)
* context, data, algorithm, processor/executor
* declarative is more readable than imperative

Testing
=======
* OO Design for Testability http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acjvKJiOvXw (Mi≈°ko Hevery, 2009)
    * new operators inside object,
    * global state, 
    * Law of Demeter violation

Architecture
============

Philosophy
* Optimize for **deletability** http://vimeo.com/108441214 by Greg Young
   * You cannot create the first model right and making a change in model that does not work is hard (and error prone). So if you could rewrite the module from scratch quickly, you can have a better model and solve problem more easily.
   * Microservices, Actors, SOA, Objects,... are all the same concept. Read Alan Key who said about "small computers exchanging messages".
   * Small programs are not a new concept, see Linux - you can rewrite ls, grep, cp and others in a week or two.
   * Reading big, interconnected codebases takes weeks, months, or years. Hence it takes a lot of time for a new person to start contributing.
   * SOA in Dutch means what STD means in English.
